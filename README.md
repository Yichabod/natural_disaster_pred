## Predicting Landslides using CNNs and Sentinel-2 Data

### Quick outline of files:
Landslide_detection_main.py trains the network and does most of the other work, uses create_dataset.py to create a dataset out of images in a folder called 'earth_engine_good'. 

Accuracy_plotter.py creates a plot of accuracies during training based on the text files in results folder(copy pasted from what the python file prints).

image_download_script.js can be pasted directly into the https://code.earthengine.google.com console and you just have to enter the coordinates of the earthquake into cropping_coordinates.py to get the bounding boxes.
